Final Data Preparation

Description:
This script processes various datasets related to electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid vehicles, transportation, parking, demographics, and other factors in Amsterdam. It aims to analyze the relationship between EV adoption and independent variables such as population, household income, land use, public transport, and more. The processed data is merged with session data containing the target variables for further analysis.

Functionality:
1. Imports and processes multiple datasets at PC6 and PC4 levels, including EV and hybrid vehicle registrations, population data, household data, income data, asset data, socioeconomic status (SES), transportation data (buses, trams, metros), parking data, and land use data.
2. Cleans the data, replaces missing values, and removes outliers where necessary.
3. Merges the independent variables at both PC6 and PC4 levels.
4. Utilizes the MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) algorithm to impute missing values in the independent variables.
5. Reads in session data containing the target variables for EV analysis.
6. Merges the target variables with the imputed independent variables.
7. Sorts the final data by date and postcode for further analysis.

Usage:
1. Ensure all the required data files are available in the specified file paths.
2. Modify the file paths in the script to match the actual paths in your local environment.
